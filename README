[*] Host OS Support

We test this package on CentOS 7.3 and Ubuntu 17.04 hosts and we recommend to use one of these two OSes.
The deployment on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 requires the modification of the Docker storage driver to devicemapper.

For other OSes you may need some extra work (and sweat or tears). 
We are happy to hear from you and eventually include instructions for other OSes.


Required software on the host:

  - install wget, fuse
  - install docker (version 17.03.1-ce or greater)
  - install docker-compose (version 1.11.2 or greater)
